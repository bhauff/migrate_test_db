Our testing system broke once we introduced VIEWS and STORED PROCEDURES to our database (a legacy MS SQL server for production, MySQL 5 for development and tests). Neither schema format (:ruby or :sql) plays nicely when exporting the schema for the database, so we opted for a workaround. The workaround runs our migration scripts to ready the test database if you set schema format to :migrate (in config/environment.rb). We were able to leverage the existing rake tasks for purging the test database, and loading the migration scripts--and we now have an excellent platform for testing our "complex" schema based app. The patch was developed by Andre Price under the direction of Jonathan Siegel at ELC Technologies.

This is a great idea for a plugin. If you release it and most Rails developers begin using it then it might be a good candidate for core. Until then I'm going to close this ticket.
